# PRELIMINARIES -------------------------------------------------------


# The general workflow when working with renv is:
#   
#   Call renv::init() to initialize a new project-local environment with a private R library,
# 
# Work in the project as normal, installing and removing new R packages as they are needed in the project,
# 
# Call renv::snapshot() to save the state of the project library to the lockfile (called renv.lock),
# 
# Continue working on your project, installing and updating R packages as needed.
# 
# Call renv::snapshot() again to save the state of your project library if your attempts to update R packages were successful, or call renv::restore() to revert to the previous state as encoded in the lockfile if your attempts to update packages introduced some new problems.

# ENTER DATA -------------------------------------------------------

# E = education (low vs. high only)
# G = sex
# Y = dementia
# C = age, age^2, study (because this was a pooled analysis)

# for this, need:
# f_e = P(E=e | G=g)
# p_{eg} = E[ Y | E=e, G=g ]
